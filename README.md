### README THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!!
By posting this repo I am DEFINATLY NOT scamming anyone. YOU SHOULD ALSO NOT USE THIS TO SCAM ANYONE. This is only here to serve as a proof of how simple it is for attackers to simulate a web login page and steal your personal information. Please, and i state it again, please never attempt any scam on anyone.<br>
## Personal localhost server setup
To run this on your own machine, you will need to have a updated Node.JS enviroment up and running. Just clone this repo and install the depedencies with `npm install`. to launch simply run index.js with `node index.js`. The localhost server should run at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> Enjoy!! ðŸ˜Š
